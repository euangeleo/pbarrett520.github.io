I am a linguist and educator driven by a passion to blend traditional language learning with modern technology, creating dynamic educational tools. My career has spanned continents and disciplines, imbuing me with a profound ability to navigate diverse cultural and technical landscapes.

**Professional Journey:**  
Having spent six transformative years in China, including during Zero COVID and the Shanghai lockdown of 2022, I have cultivated advanced leadership skills, managing diverse teams and projects in challenging environments. My tenure in China was marked by significant improvements for teams in language learning outcomes under my leadership, demonstrating my capacity to effectively bridge cultural divides.

During my time with Zmack! Consulting in Shanghai, I led the development of AI-driven software tools for an innovative improvised comedy show. This project involved designing and implementing software that integrated advanced language models to enhance live performances, showcasing my ability to apply AI technologies creatively and effectively in real-time environments.

**Technical Proficiencies:**
- Skilled in leveraging technology to solve complex problems and enhance user experiences in educational settings.

- Experienced in the strategic application of programming tools to develop and optimize both educational and entertainment software.

**Areas of Expertise:**
- **Natural Language Processing:** I specialize in developing software solutions for problems that require extensive backgound expertise in the field of Linguistics. I have experience with both neural and rules-based approaches to tasks like text generation, text-to-speech, sentiment analysis, tokenization, and more.

- **Education:** Dedicated to enhancing the learning process through innovative teaching methods and educational practices that make learning accessible and effective for diverse populations. I aspire to leverage my skills in NLP to create technologies that make education easier for both teachers and their students.

- **Leadership in Multicultural Environments:** Proven success in leading multicultural teams, driving project success through innovative strategies and inclusive leadership.

**Education:**
